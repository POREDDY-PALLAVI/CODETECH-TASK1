//*This code implements a Basic Calculator program in Java that performs arithmetic operations based on user input. Here's a simple description:

Input Numbers: The user is prompted to input two numbers.
Choose an Operation: The user selects an arithmetic operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, or Division) from a menu by entering a corresponding choice (1-4).
Perform the Operation: Based on the user's choice:
Addition, Subtraction, or Multiplication is performed directly.
For Division, the program checks if the second number is zero to avoid division by zero errors.*//
