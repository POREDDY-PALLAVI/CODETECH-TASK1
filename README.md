 Overview of the Project:

   The Simple Calculator project is a beginner-level Java application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It serves as an introduction to fundamental programming concepts, 
  user interaction, and control structures. Below is a detailed overview:
OBJECTIVE:
   To create a simple command-line calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.
KEY FEATURE:
1. User-Friendly Input:
   - Prompts the user to enter two numeric values.
   - Provides a clear menu of operations to choose from.

2. Arithmetic Operations:
   - Addition: Computes the sum of two numbers.
   - Subtraction: Computes the difference between two numbers.
   - Multiplication: Computes the product of two numbers.
   - Division: Computes the quotient of two numbers (with division-by-zero handling).

3. Error Handling:
   - Displays an error message for invalid operation choices.
   - Prevents division by zero with a specific error notification.

4. Clear Results:
   - Displays the operation performed and the resulting value.
   - Notifies the user about the success or failure of the operation.

5. Resource Management:
   - Properly closes the `Scanner` object to prevent resource leaks.
